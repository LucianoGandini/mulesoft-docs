== Using a Connector

// todo: link to Connector User Guide, explaining global elements, properties files, flows, showing example apps, MEL, linking to DevKit or SDK in See Also

You can configure and use almost any connector in Anypoint Studio by following a few general guidelines. For a tutorial on basic usage, see a link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/anypoint-connector-tutorial[tutorial] that uses a simple connector.

Import additional connectors into your Studio instance, or create applications using connectors outside of Studio by adding them as Maven dependencies to your `pom.xml` file or including connector libraries with your project.

For more information, see the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.8-m1/connectors-user-guide[Connector User Guide].

Connectors are important components of most applications that leverage the Mule runtime environment. MuleSoft classifies connectors according to who developed the connector (MuleSoft or a partner), how MuleSoft or the partner manage support for the connector and whether the connector, if developed by a partner, has passed a certification process. Most connectors enjoy active support by their developer communities, both internal and external to MuleSoft.
